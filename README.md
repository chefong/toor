<h4 align="center">Audio Tours. Anytime. Anywhere. </h4>

## Demo
(Coming soon)

## Inspiration
What if I want to take an audio tour of a national park or a University campus on my own time? What if I want to take an audio tour of a place that doesn't even offer audio tours?

With Toor, we are able to harness people's passions for the places they love to serve the curiosity of our users. 

## About

Toor is a peer to peer audio tour platform that allows users to create their own audio tours, upload them, and listen to other users' audio tours as well. The app also allows users to rate users' audio tours.

Toor first asks for a Tour name and Location. Then it allows users to pin-point, using Google Maps, the important locations in their audio tour,and then upload the associated audio clips with that point. Once the user is done marking all of the points and uploading the associated audio clips, the user can upload their tour to our platform.

## Key Features
* Create, upload, and listen to audio tours
* Audio Streaming via Firebase
* SMS notification if someone uploads a new audio tour in your area


## Built with 
* React
* Flask
* Firebase
* Google Maps API
* Twilio SMS API



## To-do
* Adding the ability to comment on an audio tour, expanding the scope outside of just college campus
* Using Google Cloud Platform to implement Speech-To-Text and NLP to filter out "bad" comments and words in audio files.
